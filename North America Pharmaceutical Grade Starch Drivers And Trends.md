<p><h2>North America Pharmaceutical Grade Starch Market Drivers and Trends</h2><p>The growing demand for pharmaceutical grade starch in North America is primarily driven by the increasing use of excipients in drug formulations. Starch is a critical component in tablet manufacturing, acting as a binder, disintegrant, and filler. The rise in chronic diseases, along with an aging population, has led to an increased demand for pharmaceutical products, further propelling the market. Additionally, advancements in biotechnology and the increasing use of modified starches for controlled-release drug formulations are enhancing the application of pharmaceutical grade starch in the region.</p><p>Another significant trend driving the North American pharmaceutical grade starch market is the shift toward natural and clean-label ingredients in drug production. Consumers and pharmaceutical companies are increasingly focusing on transparency and sustainability, which has led to a preference for plant-based starches. Furthermore, the regulatory push for safer, non-toxic excipients is driving innovation in starch production techniques. The growth of the over-the-counter drug market also supports demand, as starch plays a crucial role in formulating easy-to-consume dosage forms like tablets and capsules.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verifiedmarketreports.com/download-sample/?rid=625356&utm_source=GitHub-Jan&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">North AmericaPharmaceutical Grade Starch Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;North AmericaPharmaceutical Grade Starch Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Pharmaceutical Grade Starch Market size was valued at USD 1.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 2.4 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 6.2% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;North AmericaPharmaceutical Grade Starch Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Tereos</Li><Li> Cargill</Li><Li> Roquette</Li><Li> Visco Starch</Li><Li> Colorcon</Li><Li> Agrana</Li><Li> Paramesu Biotech</Li><Li> Shandong Liaocheng E Hua Pharmaceutical</Li><Li> SPAC Starch Products (India) Limited</Li><Li> Sanstar Biopolymers Ltd</Li><Li> Ingredion</Li><Li> Shandong Liujia</Li><Li> Universal Starch-Chem Allied Ltd</Li><Li> Hunan Er-Kang Pharmaceutical</Li><Li> Jiangxi Yipusheng Pharmaceutical</Li><Li> Shanxi Mr G Pharmaceutical</Li><Li> Shivangan Food & Pharma</Li><Li> Splenor Starch LLP</Li><Li> Weifang Shengtai Medicine</Li><Li> Taian Jinmantang</Li><Li> Anhui Sunhere Pharmaceutical Excipients</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;North AmericaPharmaceutical Grade Starch Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the North AmericaPharmaceutical Grade Starch Market apart.
